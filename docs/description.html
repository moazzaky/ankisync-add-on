AnkiSync is the first ever Anki add-on to support collaborative decks with the ability for users to suggest new edits. You can use public decks or even create private ones for your friends. This add-on is completely free, just register an account on <a href="https://www.ankisync.com" rel="nofollow">Ankisync.com</a> to get started. If you are a development wanting to contribute to our add-on, please see our <a href="https://github.com/husarcik/ankisync-add-on" rel="nofollow">github repository</a>. Thank you. &lt;3
