# AnkiSync add-on

A simple, easy to use add-on which allows users to collaborate on decks at <a href="https://www.ankisync.com">Ankisync.com</a>. 

## Description

Anki is one of the best, if not the best, software for spaced-repetition. It is very customizable in many ways but does not have an easy system in place for users to work on decks together.


## How to use

Simply install the add-on using the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1459644427">download code</a> just like any other Anki add-on. If you would like to contribute edits to the add-on, see the "<a href="#how-to-contribute">how to contribute</a>" section below.
