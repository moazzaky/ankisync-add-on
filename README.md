# AnkiSync add-on

A simple, easy to use (and FREE) Anki add-on which allows users to collaborate on decks at <a href="https://www.ankisync.com">Ankisync.com</a>. 

## Description

Anki is one of the best, if not the best, software for spaced-repetition. It is very customizable in many ways but does not have an easy system in place for users to work on decks together. To complicate things even further, it has a difficult to interface with add-on system and an unfriendly data structure. After spending several months understanding the Anki software and also getting familiar with python in general, I created the AnkiSync add-on to attempt to fill this "collaboration gap". I hope you find it useful and please reach out if you have any questions and/or concerns. Keep on, Studying on. - Eddie
